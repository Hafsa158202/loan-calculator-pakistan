    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Pakistan Smart Loan Suite is designed as a free, modern tool to simplify financial decision-making. 
    We understand that loans, repayment schedules, and Islamic financing options can be confusing, 
    so our mission is to make them clear and accessible to everyone.</p>

    <p>Our calculators allow you to quickly estimate car loans, home loans, personal loans, 
    and Islamic financing products like Murabaha and Musharakah. 
    Instead of spending hours doing manual calculations, you can instantly compare repayment options 
    and evaluate what suits your financial goals.</p>

    <p>We believe financial literacy is the key to empowerment. 
    By combining technology with user-friendly design, our platform is created to help students, families, 
    and business owners make smarter money decisions.</p>
